    const questions = [{"question": "1. Core Values\nAt the Aerospace Ground Equipment (AGE) shop of the 88th Force Support Squadron (MPF) at Wright-Patterson AFB, SrA Jensen is assisting with an equipment post-use inspection following a surge in airlift operations. His team is rushing to clear backlog items before a weekend stand-down, and the NCOIC encourages the team to sign off quickly to avoid further delays. As Jensen completes his review, he notices a missing torque check on a critical component\u2014a seemingly minor step, but one required by the tech order. The omission likely won\u2019t result in immediate failure, and the NCOIC has already moved on. Speaking up could delay equipment return and reflect poorly on the team\u2019s stats.\nWhat core value is SrA Jensen upholding by choosing to report the oversight despite the pressure?", "options": ["A. Service Before Self", "B. Excellence in All We Do", "C. Integrity First", "D. Courage"], "answer": "C", "feedback": "SrA Jensen chooses Integrity First, which involves doing what\u2019s right\u2014even when it\u2019s inconvenient, unpopular, or personally risky. Reporting the missed step shows honesty and accountability, essential to the profession of arms."}, {"question": "2. Core Values\nWithin the Avionics Flight of the 92nd Maintenance Group at Fairchild AFB, Lt Col Ramirez appoints MSgt Lee as team lead for a quarterly compliance inspection review. Over several days, Lee observes that one Airman\u2014SrA Talbot\u2014has been working extended hours without supervision to ensure checklists are updated and tool control is airtight. While Talbot\u2019s effort appears commendable, Lee also notes the rest of the team is stretched thin covering his normal duties. Some of the younger Airmen appear demoralized and resentful. As the inspection nears, Lee considers whether to formally recognize Talbot\u2019s effort or use it as an opportunity to model balanced expectations for team performance.\nWhich virtue does MSgt Lee best demonstrate through a leadership decision that prioritizes team cohesion?", "options": ["A. Respect", "B. Teamwork", "C. Duty", "D. Loyalty"], "answer": "B", "feedback": "MSgt Lee applies Teamwork, a virtue under Excellence in All We Do, by promoting shared responsibility and avoiding praise that might unintentionally undermine unit cohesion."}, {"question": "3. Problem Solving\nIn the Flightline Operations section of the 1st Special Operations Logistics Squadron at Hurlburt Field, Capt Willis takes command of a maintenance section following several delayed sortie turnarounds. Initial reviews from QA cited documentation errors and uncoordinated parts deliveries. Instead of issuing blanket guidance, Willis gathers representatives from the line, production control, supply, and QA to conduct a structured analysis.
